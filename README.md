## About

Fun little side-project of mine that was totally inspired by the everyday activities of one of my friends. Hope you will somehow find a use for this.

## Prerequisites

You should have the following things installed and setup.

* Python 3.*
* pip
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* node
* npm
* `cd server && npm i && npm run build`

## Usage

_Todo: Add a proper documentation_

Execute `python d4v1d.py` and make yourself familiar with the CLI. (In case you need help, just type `?` or `help`). _Good luck!_
