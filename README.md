## About

Fun little side-project of mine that was totally inspired by the everyday activities of one of my friends. Hope you will somehow find a use for this.

## Setup

You should have Python 3.* and pip already installed and configured on your system. Afterwards, all you need to do is run this to install all the necessary packages:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the included console line command interpreter and to start the web-interface, simply run ...

```bash
python3 d4v1d.py
```

If you ever feel lost in the CLI, just use the `help` command or `?` at anytime. _Happy h4xx0ring!_
