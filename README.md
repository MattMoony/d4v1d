## About

A social-media *social-engineering* tool. While originally inspired by one of my friends' Instagram  activities, starting from the latest version that's currently in development, `v4`, it should have the ability to be expanded to encompass **any** social-media platform.

## Setup

*To run the older, but finished version, `v2`, checkout the [`legacy`](https://github.com/MattMoony/d4v1d/tree/legacy) branch of this repository. It has its own `README.md` with all necessary setup steps.*

At the moment - as the current "version" of this tool isn't finished yet and therefore has no proper release, just *clone* the repo, install all pip dependencies and run `d4v1d.py` to be greated with an interactive shell.

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m pip install ./requirements-unix.txt
chmod 755 ./d4v1d.py
./d4v1d.py
```

### Windows

```bash
python -m pip install .\requirements-win.txt
python .\d4v1d.py
```

## Roadmap

Below is a list of things that I'm planning on incorporating / hoping to incorporate into this project. It'll probably change & grow over time. *Feel free to add more ideas if you feel like it.*
