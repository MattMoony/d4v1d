## About

Fun little side-project of mine that was totally inspired by the everyday activities of one of my friends. Hope you will somehow find a use for this.

## Setup

You should have Python 3.* and pip already installed and configured on your system. Afterwards, all you need to do is run this to install all the necessary packages:

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

_Todo: Add a proper documentation_

To use the included console line command interpreter and to start the web-interface, simply run ...

```bash
$ python d4v1d.py
```

To access the web-interface either open [http://localhost:12864/](http://localhost:12864) in any browser, or execute ...

```bash
$ browse
```

... in the d4v1d-CLI, which will automatically open the web-interface in your default browser.

If you ever feel lost in the CLI, just use the `help` command or `?` at anytime. _Happy h4xx0ring!_
